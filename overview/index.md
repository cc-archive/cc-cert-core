## Why Needed?
Since its launch in 2001 use of Creative Commons around the world has grown dramatically to the point where in 2015 there were over 1 billion Creative Commons licensed works. Writers, photographers, musicians and other creators use Creative Commons to share works and gain an audience. Cultural organizations including galleries, libraries, archives, and museums use Creative Commons to make their collections accessible to all. Use has broadened out further to include Open Educational Resources, Open Access research publishing, open data, and open science. Governments, non-profit organizations, and businesses around the world are adopting open policies and open strategies that use Creative Commons and the Internet to share and distribute resources to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity. 

With this growth comes a corresponding need to ensure creators, staff, and organizations have a thorough working knowledge of what Creative Commons is and how it works.  

The Creative Commons CORE certificate covers the full breadth and depth of learning associated with acquiring comprehensive knowledge about all aspects of Creative Commons. CORE covers a composite set of knowledge and skills associated with responsibilities across multiple roles including practitioners, administrators, and leaders. In addition to being its own standalone certificate, CORE is foundational curricula from which specialized Creative Commons certificates are built. Creative Commons certificates for librarians, educators, and government start with a subset of CORE as foundation, on top of which specialized learning is added specific to how each profession uses Creative Commons.
