# Physical and Digital Commons

Imagine a world in which someone has invented a machine that can produce perfect copies of any food item.


## The Big Question

All you have to do is put in a single bowl of rice, or slice of pizza, or an apple, or a piece of cake, and the machine can make an infinite number of perfect copies for anyone who asks. And it can make those copies instantaneously. And for free. What would that world be like?


The internet is exactly this kind of machine. All you have to do is upload a bit of writing, or an image, or a video - anything that can be represented and stored as bits - and the machine can  make an infinite number of perfect copies for anyone who asks. And it can make those copies instantaneously. And for free. And send them anywhere around the world at the speed of light. What is our world currently like? What *could* it be like if we leveraged this technology to its potential?

## Learning Outcomes

* Provide examples of physical and digital commons
* Compare scarce (physical) vs. non-scarce (digital) resources
* Explain non-rivalrous goods


## Personal Reflection / Why it Matters to You

Why do we have the internet - perhaps the perfect machine for the free and open sharing of content - but not a copy machine for food? What are some of the differences between physical things like food and digital things like videos and web pages? How do these differences change the way you engage in commons centered on digital resources?


##### Discuss It

*Consider something that you own in both physical and digital formats, e.g. books, music, film, art and share some thoughts about the affordances of sharing of each in the [Discuss Cert Community](http://discuss.certificates.creativecommons.org) or elsewhere via social media.*

There are some significant differences between physical and digital commons. The brief video [Why Open Education Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJWbVt2Nc-I) provides a high-level overview of these differences in the context of education.

For more detail on the differences between physical and digital commons, we have to look more closely at the nature of the resources around which these commons are organized. To do this with clarity, we’ll need to employ some concepts from introductory economics. 

First, we need to understand Rivalry and Excludability. 

A resource is said to be rivalrous when one person’s use of the resource interferes with another person’s use of the resource. For example, if you eat a sandwich, I can’t eat the sandwich - this makes the sandwich a rivalrous resource. By contrast, if you watch a YouTube video that doesn’t prevent me (or a million other people) from watching that same video at the same time - this makes the video is a nonrivalrous resource. Read more about [Rivalry](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)) from Wikipedia.

A resource is said to be excludable if people can be prevented from accessing it. For example, when a television show is broadcast over the air it is a nonexcludable resource because there is no way to prevent an individual with a television from watching it. By contrast, when the same television show is broadcast by satellite it is encrypted so that only people who have the right equipment and a current subscription can watch it, making the show broadcast by satellite an excludable resource. 

We can build a table of rivalrous, nonrivalrous, excludable, and nonexcludable resources like the following one from Wikipedia:


| | Excludable   | Non-excludable |
| :---:  | :---:  | :---:  |
| **Rivalrous** | [Private goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_good) <br /> food, clothing, cars, parking spaces  | [Common-pool resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource) <br /> fish stocks, timber, coal  |
| **Nonrivalrous**  | [Club goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_good) <br /> cinemas, private parks, satellite television  | [Public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) <br /> free-to-air television, air, national defense |

Take some time to explore the articles on Common-pool resources and Public goods linked in the table above. 

##### For Your Personal Learning Toolkit
*It's helpful to have some links to make these distinctions clear; see if there are more references from the Wikipedia pages with adding to your toolkit. Or you may want to find examples of Common-pool resources and Public goods that would help explain these to someone else.*

Once you understand these concepts, you will see that physical commons form around [common-pool resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-pool_resource) and digital commons form around [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good). The difference between rivalrous resources and nonrivalrous resources lies at the heart of the difference between physical and digital commons.

## Applied Practice

Explore and complete at least one of the [quests for this unit](https://certificates.creativecommons.org/quests/cats/physical-digital/).

## Closing the Loop

Although people are experimenting with [3D Food Printing](https://3dprinting.com/food/) it's not likely  the internet will become a copy machine for what we eat. But hopefully you have gotten  more  understanding of fundamental differences between digital and analog goods, especially in terms of rivalry and exclusion.

It is a good idea of your Personal Learning Toolkit includes some references to remember and share these ideas later.

We also recombined posting some examples of private goods, club goods, common-pool resources, or public goods in the [Discuss Cert community](https://discuss.certificates.creativecommons.org/) and reading some of the examples provided by others and see if you agree or disagree with how they have classified their examples.

Keep the ideas of limitless copying in mind when thinking about the commons.
