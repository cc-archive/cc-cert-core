# Unit 1: Significance of the Commons

What do Wikipedia and medieval English pasture lands have in common? (Hint: the answer is right there in the question.) And why should you care?

## The Big Question

Both Wikipedia and medieval English pasture lands are examples of a commons. [As economist David Bollier describes it](http://bollier.org/commons-short-and-sweet)

> a commons arises whenever a given community decides it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner, with special regard for equitable access, use and sustainability”.

Commons are everywhere - from modern web communities to ancient agrarian communities - and understanding what they are and how they function is key to understanding the world around us. 

You probably participate in one or more commons yourself - and by the time you finish this module you’ll be able to recognize a commons you are part of, describe what makes it a commons, and identify potential threats to the sustainability of your commons.

## Learning Outcomes

* Define the commons and its historical significance
* Describe historical and ongoing enclosure of the commons
* Provide examples of common resources
* Describe culture as a form of commons

## Opening Questions

What commons are you a part of? Can you think of a group you belong to that collectively manages a resource in order to make sure that everyone will have ongoing access to the resource? What do you contribute to your commons? 

## What is a commons, and why is it important?

Then read [The Commons, Short and Sweet](http://bollier.org/commons-short-and-sweet)  by [David Bollier](http://bollier.org/) for more detail about how commons work and why they are important. 

##  Enclosure of the Commons
Many historic commons ended in enclosure, and enclosure continues to be the single largest threat to modern commons. For a review of historical enclosures of physical commons and modern attempts to enclose the commons of ideas and culture, read The Second Enclosure Movement.


## What is Enclosure?

## Successfully Managing a Commons

It takes a lot of effort to sustain a thriving commons. Read Nobel Prize-winning commons scholar Elinor Ostrom's [8 Principles for Managing a Commons](http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons). 


## Application of Learning


### Learner Toolkit

Select two or three resources directly relevant to your personal or work-related CC needs from the Acquiring Essential Knowledge content and add them to your personal Creative Commons toolkit. Adding them to your toolkit makes them easy to find and use when the need arises, and makes it easy for you to pass on resources you consider important to others. Annotate the resources with notes explaining why they are relevant and important for you and your work.

### Community - Collaboration, Appreciation, Recognition, Gratitude

Identify a commons you participate in - think about the nature of the resources shared in the commons, some of the people who participate in the commons, and some of the community’s norms about how to create, manage, and sustain the resources in the commons. How do you benefit from your participation in that commons? Express your gratitude or appreciation to others who participate in that commons.
