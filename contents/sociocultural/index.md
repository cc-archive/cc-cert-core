# Sociocultural Module

While Creative Commons provides licenses written in legal language, the practice of sharing and reuse is grounded in a social and cultural context that contends we can be more successful in a commons of openness.

The Sociocultural module has four units of learning that can help you understand the social and cultural issues of openness so you can advocate for it in your own work.

* [How the Open Model is Better](open-better.md) How do you convince the people who you work with to openly share their work when their response is “Why would I give away what I made for free?”
* [Shifting to Open](shift-open.md)
* [Promoting Openness](promoting-open.md)
* [Community Development for Openness](community-development.md)

On completion of these four units the [final summit quest](sociocultural-summit-quest.md) combines learning from across all four units into one final assignment for the whole module.
